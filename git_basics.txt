When using the Terminal, always ensure you are in the right 
directory before making changes.

The directory for this project is /repos/git_test/

Once in this directory, to start making changes using VSCode 
enter the following terminal command:

    $ code .

This will open VSCode and allow you to make changes.
Save changes following standard Mac procedure (Cmd + S)

Back in the terminal, run the following commands:

    $ git status

(returns the status of the repository. unsaved changes will appear
in red)

    $ git add .
    //
    $ git add filename.ext

(this will add all unsaved files or a specific file to the commit list)

    $ git commit -m "Comment"
    //
    $ git commit

(this will commit changes with the comment provided in terminal, or if
no comment is given, it will open VSCode for you to add comments there.)

    $ git push

(this will push the changes, and update the repository on GitHub)
